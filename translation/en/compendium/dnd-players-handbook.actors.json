Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.</p><p>Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.</p><p>Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.</p><p>Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.</p><h2>Becoming a Monk …</h2><h3>As a Level 1 Character</h3><ul><li>Gain all the traits in the Core Monk Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Monk's level 1 features, which are listed in the Monk Features table.</li></ul><h3>As a Multiclass Character</h3><ul><li>Gain the Hit Point Die trait from the Core Monk Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Monk's level 1 features, which are listed in the Monk Features table.</li></ul>",

Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p><p>Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.</p><p>Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.</p><h2>Becoming a Paladin …</h2><h3>As a Level 1 Character</h3><ul><li>Gain all the traits in the Core Paladin Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Paladin’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Paladin Features table.</li></ul><h3>As a Multiclass Character</h3><ul><li>Gain the following traits from the Core Paladin Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency with Martial weapons, and training with Light and Medium armor and Shields.</li><li>Gain the Paladin’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Paladin Features table.

Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.</p><p>A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.</p><p>If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.</p></blockquote>",

They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.</p><p>Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.</p><p>The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.</p><p>But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p><h2>Becoming a Wizard …</h2><h3>As a Level 1 Character</h3><ul><li>Gain all the traits in the Core Wizard Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Wizard’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Wizard Features table.</li></ul><h3>As a Multiclass Character</h3><ul><li>Gain the Hit Point Die from the Core Wizard Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Wizard’s level 1 features, which are listed in the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbWizard0000000.JournalEntryPage.g7cMRWzsgAsEF7zC#class-features]{Wizard Features table}.

It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p><p><strong>One Familiar Only.</strong> You can’t have more than one familiar at a time.

Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.</p><p>Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.</p><p>Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.</p><h2>Becoming a Sorcerer …</h2><h3>As a Level 1 Character</h3><ul><li>Gain all the traits in the Core Sorcerer Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are listed in the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSorcerer00000.JournalEntryPage.fsqRUA4acVXH4I3O#class-features]{Sorcerer Features table}.</li></ul><h3>As a Multiclass Character</h3><ul><li>Gain the Hit Point Die from the Core Sorcerer Traits table.</li><li>Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.

The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.content.JournalEntry.phbSpells0000000.JournalEntryPage.VfZ5mH2ZuyFq82Ga]{Sorcerer spell list} later in the class’s description.</p><p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplLight00000]{Light}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplPrestidigi]{Prestidigitation}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplShockingGr]{Shocking Grasp}, and @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.Item.phbsplSorcerousB]{Sorcerous Burst} are recommended.

You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. <em>Burning Hands</em> and <em>Detect Magic</em> are recommended.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p><p>If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.</p><p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong> You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.</p>"
